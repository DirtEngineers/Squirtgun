Need some way to make the slug from compound loaded into cartridge

Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing and for it impacting
net.minecraftforge.registries.ForgeRegistryEntry


!! refactor SquirtCartridge to SquirtMagazine

gun takes a cartridge
cartridge holds a liquid
gun takes some liquid from cartridge when it fires
FIRING -- operates like AK-47 (open bolt from magazine)
    1.  check liquid amount in cartridge. -- anything in mag?
    2.  make new slug item and set internal reference to the liquid from cartridge -- bolt slides to chamber new round
    3.  deduct appropriate amount from cartridge -- magazine spring pushes new round up(if any)
    4.  shoot slug -- firing pin operates

loading/reloading of cartridge/magazine


So, the upshot is to use simple counters and such to track the amount of a given liquid in the cartridge and to save the data via NTB


allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags

 Lifts and modifies code from BowItem
 use net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeHooks.getProjectile as in Player#public ItemStack getProjectile(ItemStack pShootable)
 Rework enchantment values
 Need sounds for various actions
