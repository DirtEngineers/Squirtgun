Background:
Tracking fluid levels in individual phials is proving far too complex from a development and item management point of view.

Current approach:
The gun stacks to 1 and holds a phial for use.
Phials stack to whatever and individually tracks the chemical, fluid, and shots available.
That is the part presenting the problem.

Proposed solution:
A chemical phial would hold a reference to the particular chemical (as per current).                                    DONE
Add the chemical reference to the gun                                                                                   DONE
Migrate the fluid and shot capacity functionality to the gun                                                            DONE
Add these to the NBT data for the gun.                                                                                  DONE
Phials are one-shot in that when they are loaded into the gun, the gun does its thing and returns an Empty phial item.  DONE
The actual fluid is only dealt with when the gun makes a slug to fire.                                                  DONE
