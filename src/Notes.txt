SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

   Recipes:
   1.  Recipe for gun                                       -- DONE
   2.  Recipe for generic phial item in crafting bench      -- DONE

Leather bandolier with brass filigree trim

Upgrade strategy:
Gun ->
1.  Autoload. Gun uses that KIND of phial until all non-empty ones are exhausted.  Allow player to toggle behavior in gun UI
2.  Upgrades for gun shot capacity
3.  Multiple slugs/shot
4.  3-round burst
5.  fully automatic

Phial ->
1.  Upgrades for capacity
2.  Possible upgrades for mob effects?
3.  Ability to load potions

General ->
Effects on blocks?  Need something like a pH scale to chemicals (chemlib)
Consider honey
API-fying chemlib to load custom JSON for chemicals/fluids


Look into custom mob effects for fluids
Migrate effects for fluids to a separate JSON for later modder support
1.  Create JSON file
2.  Write a factory to build/register the custom effects
3.  Serialize it to create the custom effects
4.  make association with chemicals in CommonSetupEvent

RELEASE TASKS:
Get and install models/textures for gun and encapsulator
Change sounds -- Audacity libraries!
Make phial buttons use the default MC background
Making the phials into buttons would work too, give them a button-y background
Using the button background from default Minecraft would let it automatically change with texture packs as well

Arcana â€” Today at 9:46 PM
General play testing.  Test with different mods.
Make sure everything looks nice, textures are good. Your reload menu didn't have a textured background.
Make sure everything makes sense to a user or has some way of describing how to do it.
Write a description for the mod page.

ISSUE: Lava and Milk show up in Chemlib tab with no image

just make sure you're using forge tags in all the recipes and it'll automatically be compatible with mods that add alloying machines
Add mineable tags to brass block and encapsulator

Make encapsulator recipe

Need models for:
Gun Grip                    -- Waiting on final model
Gun Actuator                -- Waiting on final model
Gun Barrel Assembly         -- Waiting on final model
Gun Phial Mount             -- Waiting on final model

Encapsulator should set progress to 0 when item removed from input slot.

!!--- API-ify chemlib
One step would be to allow outside access to create/register compounds like a helper function to pass in the json.
