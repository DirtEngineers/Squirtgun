Gun is loaded from a magazine.
magazine loads gun's internal magazine.  It exchanges contents with the gun's internal magazine.

allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags -- maybe

SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Rework enchantment values
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

 make a custom keybind that opens a screen if you have the gun in your inventory.
 The screen should have a slot where you can put the magazine.

 UPGRADE! -- Default manually load and auto-load being an upgrade.  Also allow player to toggle auto-load behavior in the gun's UI

 !!! Tie magazine loading to game events like pause and game end.
