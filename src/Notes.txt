Upgrade strategy:
Gun ->
1.  Autoload. Gun uses that KIND of phial until all non-empty ones are exhausted.  Allow player to toggle behavior in gun UI
2.  Upgrades for gun shot capacity
3.  Multiple slugs/shot
4.  3-round burst
5.  fully automatic

Phial ->
1.  Upgrades for capacity
2.  Possible upgrades for mob effects?
3.  Ability to load potions


Consider honey
Also consider potions

Look into custom mob effects for fluids
Migrate effects for fluids to a separate JSON for later modder support
1.  Create JSON file
2.  Write a factory to build/register the custom effects
3.  Serialize it to create the custom effects
4.  make association with chemicals in CommonSetupEvent
