Get chemlib compounds pre-registration to make and register ammo entities
Also required for filling/unloading cartridges
Need some way to make the slug from compound loaded into cartridge

Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing and for it impacting

gun takes a cartridge
cartridge holds a liquid
gun takes some liquid from cartridge when it fires
FIRING
    1.  check liquid amount in cartridge.
    2.  make new slug item and set internal reference to the liquid from cartridge
    3.  deduct appropriate amount from cartridge
    4.  shoot slug

loading/reloading?


So, the upshot is to use simple counters and such to track the amount of a given liquid in the cartridge and to save the data via NTB


allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags
