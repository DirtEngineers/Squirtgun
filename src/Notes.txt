Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing

SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

CHANGE LOADING so that you can load up the same kind of phial that is currently loaded in the gun

   Recipes:

   2.  Recipe for generic phial item in crafting bench      -- DONE
   3.  Recipe for phial types and fill (eg: HCl phial)      -- WORKING
   4.  Recipes for phial upgrades
   5.  Recipe for phial from raw materials in machine

Leather bandolier with brass filigree trim

Upgrade strategy:
Gun ->
1.  Autoload. Gun uses that KIND of phial until all non-empty ones are exhausted.  Allow player to toggle behavior in gun UI
2.  Upgrades for gun shot capacity
3.  Multiple slugs/shot
4.  3-round burst
5.  fully automatic

Phial ->
1.  Upgrades for capacity
2.  Possible upgrades for mob effects?
3.  Ability to load potions

Effects on blocks?  Need something like a pH scale to chemicals (chemlib)


Consider honey
Also consider potions

Look into custom mob effects for fluids
Migrate effects for fluids to a separate JSON for later modder support
1.  Create JSON file
2.  Write a factory to build/register the custom effects
3.  Serialize it to create the custom effects
4.  make association with chemicals in CommonSetupEvent

RELEASE TASKS:
Get and install models/textures for gun and encapsulator
Change sounds -- Audacity libraries!
Make phial buttons use the default MC background
Making the phials into buttons would work too, give them a button-y background
Using the button background from default Minecraft would let it automatically change with texture packs as well

Arcana â€” Today at 9:46 PM
General play testing.  Test with different mods.
Make sure everything looks nice, textures are good. Your reload menu didn't have a textured background.
Make sure everything makes sense to a user or has some way of describing how to do it.
Write a description for the mod page.

I need to talk to you some time about how I am registering milk and lava as fluids.
