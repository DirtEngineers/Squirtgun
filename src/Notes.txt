Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing

Leather bandolier with brass filigree trim

Upgrade strategy:
Gun ->
1.  Autoload. Gun uses that KIND of phial until all non-empty ones are exhausted.  Allow player to toggle behavior in gun UI
2.  Upgrades for gun shot capacity
3.  Multiple slugs/shot
4.  3-round burst
5.  fully automatic

Phial ->
1.  Upgrades for capacity
2.  Possible upgrades for mob effects?
3.  Ability to load potions

Effects on blocks?  Need something like a pH scale to chemicals (chemlib)


Consider honey
Also consider potions

Look into custom mob effects for fluids
Migrate effects for fluids to a separate JSON for later modder support
1.  Create JSON file
2.  Write a factory to build/register the custom effects
3.  Serialize it to create the custom effects
4.  make association with chemicals in CommonSetupEvent

RELEASE TASKS:
Get and install models/textures for gun and encapsulator
Change sounds -- Audacity libraries!
Make phial buttons use the default MC background
Making the phials into buttons would work too, give them a button-y background
Using the button background from default Minecraft would let it automatically change with texture packs as well

Arcana â€” Today at 9:46 PM
General play testing.  Test with different mods.
Make sure everything looks nice, textures are good. Your reload menu didn't have a textured background.
Make sure everything makes sense to a user or has some way of describing how to do it.
Write a description for the mod page.

I need to talk to you some time about how I am registering milk and lava as fluids.
