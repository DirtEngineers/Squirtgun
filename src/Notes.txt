Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing and for it impacting

loading/reloading?

allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags -- maybe

SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

 make a custom keybind that opens a screen if you have the gun in your inventory.
 The screen should have a slot where you can put the magazine.

 UPGRADE! -- Default manually load and auto-load being an upgrade.  Also allow player to toggle auto-load behavior in the gun's UI

   look at making base magazine abstract
   look into making an interface for magazine upgrades.  Also toggle on/off
