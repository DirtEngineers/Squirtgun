Get chemlib compounds pre-registration to make and register ammo entities

Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing and for it impacting

Gun is loaded from a magazine.
magazine loads gun's internal magazine and then is discarded (ItemStack.EMPTY).
when gun fires, it creates a slug entity from the fluid in the internal magazine.

FIRING
    1.  check liquid amount in cartridge.
    2.  make new slug item and set internal reference to the liquid from cartridge
    3.  deduct appropriate amount from cartridge
    4.  shoot slug

loading/reloading?

allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags -- maybe
