Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing and for it impacting

Gun is loaded from a magazine.
magazine loads gun's internal magazine.  If the internal magazine is empty, the magazine is discarded (ItemStack.EMPTY).
Otherwise, it exchanges contents with the gun's internal magazine.

loading/reloading?

allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags -- maybe

SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Lifts and modifies code from BowItem
 use net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeHooks.getProjectile as in Player#public ItemStack getProjectile(ItemStack pShootable)
 Rework enchantment values
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

 make a custom keybind that opens a screen if you have the gun in your inventory.
 The screen should have a slot where you can put the magazine.

 UPGRADE! -- Default manually load and auto-load being an upgrade.  Also allow player to toggle auto-load behavior in the gun's UI
