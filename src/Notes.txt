Set up a custom sound for the ammunition firing

allow later modders to add liquid ammunition via tags -- maybe

SQUIRTGUNITEM:
 Need sounds for various actions
 Need advancements for item use

Upgrade strategy:
Gun ->
1.  Autoload. Gun uses that KIND of phial until all non-empty ones are exhausted.  Allow player to toggle behavior in gun UI
2.  Upgrades for gun shot capacity

Phial ->
1.  Upgrades for capacity
2.  Possible upgrades for mob effects?


SET SHADER COLOR BACK TO DEFAULT AFTER RENDERING!
public static void setShaderColor(int pColor) {
        float alpha = (pColor >> 24 & 255) / 255f;
        float red = (pColor >> 16 & 255) / 255f;
        float green = (pColor >> 8 & 255) / 255f;
        float blue = (pColor & 255) / 255f;
        RenderSystem.setShaderColor(red, green, blue, alpha);
    }
Utility command in AbstractProcessingScreen.

Consider honey and lava

Look into custom mob effects for fluids
Migrate effects for fluids to a separate JSON for later modder support
1.  Create JSON file
2.  Write a factory to build/register the custom effects
3.  Serialize it to create the custom effects
4.  make association with chemicals in CommonSetupEvent
